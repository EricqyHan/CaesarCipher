# CaesarCipher

After watchng Mr. Robot, I always wanted to write my own code to crack the ROT13 algrithm. It took me a while, but I was able to come up with the solution one night for a codewars challenge. I was able to modify it with an extra parameter tha premitted me to pick the shift value from between one and twenty&#8208;five.
